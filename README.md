# ðŸ“œ Code Diary - Auto Commit Log  

This section is automatically generated by the **Code Diary VS Code extension**. It keeps track of recent coding activities by logging timestamps, project names, and brief summaries of code changes.  

## ðŸ›  How It Works  
- Every time you make changes, this section updates with the latest logs.  
- Entries are formatted with timestamps and project details for better tracking.  
- Useful for maintaining a **daily coding journal** and **progress history**.
